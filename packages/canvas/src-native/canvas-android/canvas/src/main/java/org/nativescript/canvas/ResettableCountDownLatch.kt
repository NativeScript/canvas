/**
 * A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until
 * a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.
 *
 *
 * A `CountDownLatch` is initialized with a given *count*.
 * The [await][.await] methods block until the current count reaches
 * zero due to invocations of the [.countDown] method, after which
 * all waiting threads are released and any subsequent invocations of
 * [await][.await] return immediately.  This is a one-shot phenomenon
 * -- the count cannot be reset.  If you need a version that resets the
 * count, consider using a [CyclicBarrier].
 *
 *
 * A `CountDownLatch` is a versatile synchronization tool
 * and can be used for a number of purposes.  A
 * `CountDownLatch` initialized with a count of one serves as a
 * simple on/off latch, or gate: all threads invoking [await][.await]
 * wait at the gate until it is opened by a thread invoking [ ][.countDown].  A `CountDownLatch` initialized to *N*
 * can be used to make one thread wait until *N* threads have
 * completed some action, or some action has been completed N times.
 *
 *
 * A useful property of a `CountDownLatch` is that it
 * doesn't require that threads calling `countDown` wait for
 * the count to reach zero before proceeding, it simply prevents any
 * thread from proceeding past an [await][.await] until all
 * threads could pass.
 *
 *
 * **Sample usage:** Here is a pair of classes in which a group
 * of worker threads use two countdown latches:
 *
 *  * The first is a start signal that prevents any worker from proceeding
 * until the driver is ready for them to proceed;
 *  * The second is a completion signal that allows the driver to wait
 * until all workers have completed.
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Driver { // ...
 * void main() throws InterruptedException {
 * CountDownLatch startSignal = new CountDownLatch(1);
 * CountDownLatch doneSignal = new CountDownLatch(N);
 *
 * for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) // create and start threads
 * new Thread(new Worker(startSignal, doneSignal)).start();
 *
 * doSomethingElse();            // don't let run yet
 * startSignal.countDown();      // let all threads proceed
 * doSomethingElse();
 * doneSignal.await();           // wait for all to finish
 * }
 * }
 *
 * class Worker implements Runnable {
 * private final CountDownLatch startSignal;
 * private final CountDownLatch doneSignal;
 * Worker(CountDownLatch startSignal, CountDownLatch doneSignal) {
 * this.startSignal = startSignal;
 * this.doneSignal = doneSignal;
 * }
 * public void run() {
 * try {
 * startSignal.await();
 * doWork();
 * doneSignal.countDown();
 * } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} // return;
 * }
 *
 * void doWork() { ... }
 * }
 *
</pre> *
 *
 *
 * Another typical usage would be to divide a problem into N parts,
 * describe each part with a Runnable that executes that portion and
 * counts down on the latch, and queue all the Runnables to an
 * Executor.  When all sub-parts are complete, the coordinating thread
 * will be able to pass through await. (When threads must repeatedly
 * count down in this way, instead use a [CyclicBarrier].)
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Driver2 { // ...
 * void main() throws InterruptedException {
 * CountDownLatch doneSignal = new CountDownLatch(N);
 * Executor e = ...
 *
 * for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) // create and start threads
 * e.execute(new WorkerRunnable(doneSignal, i));
 *
 * doneSignal.await();           // wait for all to finish
 * }
 * }
 *
 * class WorkerRunnable implements Runnable {
 * private final CountDownLatch doneSignal;
 * private final int i;
 * WorkerRunnable(CountDownLatch doneSignal, int i) {
 * this.doneSignal = doneSignal;
 * this.i = i;
 * }
 * public void run() {
 * try {
 * doWork(i);
 * doneSignal.countDown();
 * } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} // return;
 * }
 *
 * void doWork() { ... }
 * }
 *
</pre> *
 *
 *
 * Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
 * `countDown()`
 * [*happen-before*](package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility)
 * actions following a successful return from a corresponding
 * `await()` in another thread.
